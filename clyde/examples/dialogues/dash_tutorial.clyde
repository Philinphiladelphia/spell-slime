Grandpa: I've got something for you, squirt.
Grandpa: You saw that slick teleport just now? You can do it too, with a little help.
Grandpa: I was saving this til your 18th slimeday, but looks like now's the time.
Grandpa: Press Q to activate the dash orb.
Grandpa: It'll only move you a short ways, but that means a lot in combat. I'll give anyslime on the other end a good shock too.
Grandpa: Violet is ready, yellow means it's on cooldown, and red means the teleport location is blocked.
Grandpa: One more thing. Dashing takes mana, so if you're out, your goose is cooked.
Grandpa: One of the Slimelord's minions is on the way. Show them what you're made of!
