Grandpa:  Squirt...
Slimey: I'm so sorry grandpa. I didn't mean to touch anything. But what is this place?
Grandpa:  Not much time to explain. This is my work, and my fault. You should never have been able to find this place.
Grandpa:  We've gotta make this quick, it won't be long before those damn abominations find us. We're like a copper lighthouse now.
Grandpa: See these orbs? They're insulation. This machine is something that should no longer exist. A relic of a worse time. A terrible weapon.
Grandpa: I kept it here to hide it. I should have destroyed it. I was a fool...
Grandpa: We have bigger problems now. I can already hear them. Get upstairs, I've activated the defenses.
Slimey: Grandpa? I don't understand...
Grandpa: Now's not the time. Get moving, we're in danger. Sorry, squirt.
